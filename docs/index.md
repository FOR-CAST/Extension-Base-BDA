# What is the Climate BDA Extension?

The Climate BDA module simulates tree mortality following major outbreaks of insects and/or disease, where major outbreaks are defined as those significant enough to influence forest succession, fire disturbance, or harvest disturbance at landscape scales. Notable additions for v5 include: variable temporal resolution, addition of climate modifiers affecting disturbance behavior, changes to the dispersal algorithm, and some additional options for communication with the Dynamic Fuels extension.
